1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because the feature is a combination of multiple components in both frontend and backend. Unit tests are designed to test individual components of a program, therefore, the "message" feature as a whole is not suitable for unit tests.
2. I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because it is a component of the "message" feature that can be easily tested with a few tests because it does not involve many moving components.
